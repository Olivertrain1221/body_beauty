### User Stories

From the Epics, 13 User Stories were developed. Each story was then given also  was assigned a classification of Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have. Each story was also assigned its own points that could be broken further this allowed me the chance to understand how the site was developing and also allow time planning which I consistently tried to work toward.
